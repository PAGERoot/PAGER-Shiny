The gene data can be either coming from gene reporter fluoresce data, such as the ones coming from CellSet, or gene expression data coming from transcriptomic experiments. \r\n\r\nPAGE-Root was designed to work with root related data, but could be easily adapter to any type of spatially register data. \r\n\r\n## Before running PAGE-Root\r\n\r\nSome dependencies are needed before running PAGE-Root. These are mainly needed for the display of the different root cell layers. \r\n\r\n\r\n### rsvg\r\n\r\nInformations about the `rsvg` package can be found here: [https://github.com/jeroenooms/rsvg#installation]()\r\n\r\nBinary packages for **OS-X** or **Windows** can be installed directly from CRAN:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"rsvg\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstallation from source on Linux or OSX requires [`librsvg2`](https://developer.gnome.org/rsvg/). On **Debian** or **Ubuntu** install [librsvg2-dev](https://packages.debian.org/testing/librsvg2-dev):\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install -y librsvg2-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn **Fedora**, **CentOS or RHEL** we need [librsvg-devel](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/librsvg2-devel):\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo yum install librsvg-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn **OS-X** use [rsvg](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/librsvg.rb) from Homebrew:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install librsvg\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### XML\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Linux users, some dependencies needs to be installed to use the `XML` package in R:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev\r\nsudo apt-get install libxml2-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Running PAGE-Root\r\n\r\nPAGE-Root has been developed as a Shiny app, to ease its maintenance and deployment. \r\n\r\nRunning the app is really simple an does not require any coding skills:\r\n\r\n1. Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (if you do not have the latest version of R, it will help to update it)\r\n2. (*Optional*) Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) \r\n3. Open `R` and, in the console, type in the following code:\r\n\r\n``` \r\ninstall.packages(\"shiny\")\r\nlibrary(\"shiny\")\r\nshiny::runGitHub(\"PAGERoot/PAGER-Shiny\", \"PAGERoot\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. PAGE-Root will open, either in a new window if you are using `RStudio`, or in your favorite web browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n> The first time PAGE-Root is launched, it might take some time, since it has to install multiple libraries on your system. Do not worry and take a coffee :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using PAGE-Root\r\n\r\n### Without your own dataset\r\n\r\n- check `Use example data`\r\n- click `Load and analyse data`\r\n- wait for the loading to be over\r\n- click `Plot data`\r\n",
